    "Our project is aimed to simulate a covid outbreak throughout the Bristol first year population, using the SIR method of simulating epidemics. This approach splits the population into 3 categories â€“ susceptible, infected or recovered. New infections can then be modelled based on the interactions of susceptible and infected people. We sought to analyse the effect of international students entering the population and coming in from areas with different infection rates compared to the local population, as well as considering the effect of social interactions and university holidays on the covid prevalence in the population. In order to run, the programme must be given initial conditions which include a text file of the names of all the people in the population and initial infection proportions for the top five most prevelent nationalities entering the university at the start of term.\n",

    "We sought to use agent-based modelling of infections, meaning our model considered individual interactions between actors to produce new infections. Each actor was created as a class instance with attributes including halls, origin and course - all of which where used in conjunction with a randomly attributed social number to determine the number of social interactions each student took part in and as a result the number of opportunities for infection. We chose classes as it allowed us to store a large number of attributes for a single object, while also allowing the set of actors in our population to be stored in lists.\n",
    "For attributes such as halls and country of origin these were allocated with randomly from a weighted distribution, allowing for the creation of unique actors. For the country of origin attribute our weightings are imported from a .CSV file allowing us to model a variety of scenarios and the consequences external populations, and their relative infection rate have on this hypothetical covid outbreak. These properties initialise themselves in the self-constructor, as do all other attributes. Since our class only takes one integer argument we were able to create instances using simple iteration, creating as many objects as specified in our population variable."

    "To infect people we initially use our infectRandomStudent function which randomly infects a size of the student population. Then we use our Infected Function with arguments, (Day,DateRange, S,I,R), which assigns a value n which is a number that defines how likely an infectious person is to infect the person they interact with and that value of n=0.2. Furthermore through our function we iterate through the different SIR statuses over each day and for those who are infected we check for how long they are infected for. If a student has been infected for longer than 14 days they will recover and their date of recovery will be added to the attribute. This way we can keep track of people recovering from being infected. Then we iterate through how many people a person has come into contact with each day and multiply this social number, being the number of people they interact with, and the variable n to infect people who come into contact with infected people and keeps note of the date of infection and stores it as an attribute. Recovery time is 30 days and once a person passes those 30 days he or she becomes susceptible again. We used classes to create objects each holding different values for the data on students and used for loops to range over the student population in order to iterate through each person. "

    "The main.py file produces an array with the dates from September until present to initiate the â€˜SIRâ€™ time series. For each â€˜SIRâ€™ status an empty list is created in order to start collecting data respectively.  University breaks such as Christmas, Easter and Reading weeks have also been accounted for. This is because during breaks people tend to travel to return home thus increasing the chances of them being infected. We managed to do this by applying ranges for these specific dates and in some instances randomly infecting some people to obtain infections due to traveling. For weekdays we add normal infection data .In addition, for weekend days (Sat, Sun) we decided to iterate through the students and apply a weighted choice of whether or not an individual decides to study on a weekend day along with other weighted choices with lists of places to study, go out and activities people enjoy to entertain. Each of the variables in these lists adds a number of people you interact with, increasing or decreasing your social value. This is to give us changing values for the interactions each person has and make it as realistic as possible. Finally we format the â€˜SIRâ€™ values for plotting into a time series and then a function that plots the main â€˜SIRâ€™ time series for the whole simulation is called. In the end an excel file in the directory with all the attributes of the population is created."
